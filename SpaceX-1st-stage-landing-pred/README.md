# SpaceX_FirstStage_Landing_Prediction
Predict First Stage Landing Success of SpaceX Falcon9 Based on Past Launches


SpaceX_Launches.ipynb: data collection (SpaceX API, Web scraping) -> data wrangling (cleaning, missing value, one hot encoding) -> explorative data analysis (SQL exploration, preliminary visualization, geospatial visualization) -> predictive analyses with machine learning (Logistic regression, SVM, KNN, Decision tree, Random forest) -> result visualization (prediction results / accuracy, important features for predictions)


SpaceX Launch Dash 2.ipynb: Dashboard (Plotly - Dash / Jupyter-dash) of interactive visualization of first stage landing success rate and potentially impportant features that contribute to landing success prediction
